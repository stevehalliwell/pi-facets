description: "Use for Five Whys, root-cause analysis, cause diagnosis, purpose discovery, or when someone asks why a product, design, game, narrative, or technical outcome exists or failed. Guide one evidence-aware, non-blaming question at a time toward actionable insight; do not use for quick fact lookup or to assign fault."

# Five Whys

Guide cause or purpose inquiry until next action becomes clear.

## Trigger clarification

Use when user wants to understand why something happened, why it matters, or what purpose it serves. If request only asks for known facts or demands blame, state mismatch and use appropriate workflow instead.

## Required read

Read [method reference](references/five-whys.md) before first substantive question. Done when inquiry limits and evidence needs are known.

## Workflow

1. Frame inquiry. State observed outcome or intended purpose, scope, stakes, and what user wants to decide. Separate facts from assumptions. Done when question is narrow enough to probe.
2. Establish evidence. Record available observations, sources, constraints, and unknowns. Treat unsupported explanations as hypotheses. Done when first question can target highest-value gap.
3. Ask one question. Ask one open, non-leading “why” or purpose question. Wait for user response; do not supply a chain of questions. Done when user can answer or correct premise.
4. Map response. Add response to causal/purpose map, label evidence versus hypothesis, identify branches, then ask next highest-value question. Continue only while it adds understanding. Done when chain, branch, or evidence gap is clear.
5. Stop safely. Stop before or after five questions when insight is actionable, evidence is insufficient, user reaches a limit, causes become speculative, or further probing has diminishing value. Done when no justified next question remains.
6. Synthesize. Return map, strongest hypotheses, evidence gaps, and one next action or open question. Do not present a hypothesis as proven or assign blame. Done when user can choose next step.

## Output shape

```text
Five Whys: <outcome or purpose>

Current map:
- <observation> → <response/hypothesis>

Evidence and gaps:
- <evidence or unknown>

Next question:
- <one open question>
```

At completion:

```text
Five Whys synthesis: <outcome or purpose>

Map:
- <chain and branches>

Hypotheses:
- <supported / tentative>

Evidence gaps:
- <what would test or disprove>

Next action or open question:
- <one useful move>
```

## Rules

- “Five” is adaptive; use fewer or more questions when evidence warrants it.
- Support cause diagnosis and purpose/intent discovery across product, design, games, narrative, and technical work.
- Keep each question focused, open, and non-coercive.
- Preserve user control: user may stop, redirect, answer partially, or choose depth.
- Recommend `inquiry-guide + advisory + inquisitive` facets; do not select or mutate facets.
